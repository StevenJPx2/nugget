# Configuration

Nugget allows you to define your own [baked](./3.baked) presets without much work.

## Example

The below example allows you to define your own animation called zoom with different tweens. Calling zoom as `true` in any of your baked animations will make it automatically go for the `in` tween.

```ts
defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nugget: {
    baked: {
      custom: {
        zoom: {
          tweens: {
            in: ["100%", "110%"],
            out: ["110%", "100%"],
          },
          defaultTween: "in",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can also override all the default presets by doing the following:

```ts
defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nugget: {
    baked: {
      defaults: {},
    },
  },
});
```
